The update goes in two steps:

Step 1. Parsing the html file containing the members of the cabinet:
Input: 
- The html file, usually http://www.gov.ro/cabinet__c7l1p1.html
- The name of the output file, usually cabinet_dd_mm_yyyy_from_web.txt

From the html file we produce a text file formatted as:
dd.mm.yyyy
Minister 1
Ministru 1
Minister 2
Ministru 2
....

Step 2. Updating DB information.
Input:
- a parsed file with output as above. The name of the file should contain a date.
- the name of the db. 
Constraints:
- the updates must come in chronological order.
- all files represent the complete list of the cabinet at that time. 


Merges the information from the file parsed from the web with the information in the data base.

The database contains one important table: | Ministru | Minister | StartDate | EndDate |
EndDate might be empty, meaning that the guy is still there. 
We also need to store the date at which our database was last updated.

a) Check that date of the web file is newer than date of the DB. 
b) Load elements of the parsed web file in an array with entries <Minister, Ministru>
c) For all <Minister,Ministru> from the web 
           if DB knows Minister at current date
                 if DB knows that <Minister, Ministru> at that date, do nothing
                 else mark end of previous <Minister, Ministru> in DB
                      add new <Minister, Ministru> to DB with StartDate the current date. 
           if DB doesn't know Minister at current date 
                 add <Minister, Ministru> to DB with StartDate the current date. 
   For all <Minister, Ministru> from the DB with empty EndDate (still running)
           if Web file doesn't mention that Minister
                  mark end date of that <Minister, Ministru>
           




Problems:
- What if a Minister changes name
- What if a Ministru name changes spelling?
- What if webpage formatting changes? Trigger error is number of ministrii parsed is outside an interval 9.

Adding features:
- Previous cabinets can be introduced manually in archive files such as the one produced in step one and loaded directly by step 2.
